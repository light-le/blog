            <p>If you are like me who like reading and writing and tinkering with new techs, you would find ChatGPT (or GenAI in general) irresistable as a writing tool. I wouldn't trust it to write my codes as far as I can throw it. There's the whole debate about how AI are going to replace us developers and white-collar workers. I also see a lot of my colleagues are also using it to speed up at works. Me? I don't buy it. For me coding and solving problems is the fun part of doing the job - my job - why taking it away? And if you hate coding or are too lazy to do it yourself that you have to uses something to do the job for you then I've got bad news for you buddy, you're in the wrong line of jobs.</p>
<p>However, writing is a fair game. I'm not a proffesional writer. But I do have some ideas I want to write about. Not for this blog of course. But something else much bigger like a book. As an average person I'm far from being a book writer. ChatGPT helps me bridge that gap. You could prompt it to write a book about any topic that you like. Then it would articulate your ideas into a full-fledged book, chapter by chapter. Sometimes it even surprises myself by giving me ideas for the next chapter. As I prompt it, it also prompts me. This thing is amazing. Let me give an example:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>Prompt: I would like to write a fantasy-themed book about wizards fighting pirates.
</span><span>
</span><span>Answer (quoted by Gemini): Excellent! A fantasy story about wizards fighting pirates is a phenomenal concept, brimming with potential for high-stakes action, unique world-building, and fascinating character dynamics. It&#39;s a clash of two very different worlds: the disciplined, knowledge-based world of magic versus the chaotic, freedom-seeking world of the sea.
</span><span>Here is a comprehensive guide to help you brainstorm and structure your book, filled with ideas for world-building, characters, plot, and themes.
</span><span>
</span><span>1. The Core Conflict: Magic vs. Mayhem
</span><span>First, let&#39;s break down the central conflict. Why are they fighting? This will be the engine of your story.
</span><span>Order vs. Freedom: Wizards often represent structure, ancient laws, and control (over the elements, over society). Pirates represent ultimate freedom, rebellion, and a rejection of all laws but their own. This is a powerful philosophical clash.
</span><span>Knowledge vs. Instinct: A wizard might spend a decade learning a single spell. A pirate captain learns to read the wind and the enemy&#39;s eyes in a heartbeat. Who is more powerful? The one who can summon a meteor, or the one who can navigate a maelstrom by feel?
</span><span>Magic vs. &quot;Technology&quot;: While it&#39;s fantasy, the pirates&#39; &quot;technology&quot; (cannons, gunpowder, ship design, intricate rope systems) can be a great foil for magic. A perfectly aimed cannonball can be just as deadly as a fireball, and perhaps much quicker.
</span><span>
</span><span>...
</span></code></pre>
<p>And then it would go on and on about the World and character buildups and plot hooks and whatnots. I don't feel like I'm writing a book anymore, but more like reading an interactive story that I have some control over the plots.</p>
<p>There are some speculations about how generative AI is going to change the way we consume media, espcially movies and TV shows. That instead of adding 'hard-coded' contents, streaming companies could make them more interactive. Users would not just sit back and passively watch them, they would have more control over the outcomes of them movies. Outcomes that even the director wouldn't know themselves. Well at least not exactly. You want the bad guys to gain more advantages? Prompt it. You don't like the way the main character look? Give it a picture of someone you like. This is borderline unethical but the point is. We have the tech. Now more than ever to make it a reality we need engineers, and not someone who is just trying to get out of their day-to-day job by vibe coding.</p>
<p>This leads to the next product that I'm building. A game that utilizes LLM to constantly generate contents for player to choose. A game with infinite endings. More on that in my next post.</p>
